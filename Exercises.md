# <int> Question 1: </ins>
## Program a function which takes in a number (n) as a(n) parameter/argument and
## print a list of increasing positive even numbers that has n numbers

### Example : increasing_even(4) --> [2, 4, 6, 8]

# <ins> Question 2: </ins>
## Code the f(n) function which takes in a number as an argument
## and return the first n fibonacci numbers
### The fibonacci sequence is defined as : f(1) = f(2) = 1, f(n + 2) = f(n + 1) + f(n)

## Example : f(5) --> 1 1 2 3 5

# <ins> Question 3: </ins>
## Code a clock function which takes in a tuple and a number as an argument.
## The tuple describes the current time (hour, minute) and the number is in minutes
## The function then prints out the time which is 'number' minutes after the given time (hour, minute)

## Example : time_past( (8, 30), 30 ) --> (9, 0)
## Exaplanation : The current time is 8h30, and we have to fast forward 30 minutes, making it 9 o'clock
## Hence (9, 0) as in 9 hours and 0 minutes

# <ins> Question 4 </ins>
## Code a function which takes in a tuple of tuples as an argument
## The function then returns the sum of all columns and rows in the board described
## Example : sum((1, 3, 5),
##               (2, 4, 6),
##               (3, 5 ,7)) --> 75

# <ins> Question 5 </ins>
## Code a function which takes in a 2 numbers `n` and `q` as an argument
## The function returns the number of numbers that is divisible by q from `0` to `n`
## Example : count_div(100, 3) --> 34
